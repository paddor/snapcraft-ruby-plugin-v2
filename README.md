# Snapcraft Ruby build plugin (v2 API)

For now this is a local snapcraft plugin. The end goal is to make this an official Snapcraft build plugin that can build Ruby for a snap based on `core20`.

Current issues are load paths. It would be nice if no wrapper script is needed for Ruby to find its stdlib and gems.
